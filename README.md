Anarchy Unix. E.n.o.u.g.h. s.a.i.d
## Running
If the workflow works, then go to actions, and click one of the runs that worked. Then look under artifacts, and download the .iso.zip file. Unzip, then `qemu-system-i386 anarchy-unix.iso`
## Why are all the comments so rude?
Because I'm a 13 yr old having a sh\*tty day who has "Labor Day" by the Dead Milkmen stuck in their head. I don't even know who Jerry Lewis ***is***!!!
